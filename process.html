			<h2>Preparation</h2>
      <h3>1. Install & Understand Brackets</h3>
      <a href="http://brackets.io">http://brackets.io</a>
      <p>In order to work on these tasks, you will need to download and insall the "Brackets" editor. This video walks you through the process. The video also talks you through a couple of very important aspects of "Brackets", so unless you have used it before and are familiar with its functionality, you should watch this video to gain the background knowledge that will prepare you for your studio session"</p>

      <h3>2. Set up a Miro account</h3>
      <p>If you don't already have one, head over to <a href="https://miro.com">https://miro.com</a> and set up an account.</p>


      <h2>Studio Tasks</h2>
      <div class="left-example">
        <h2>TASK 1: POSTER FACTORY as DESIGN AND THE WHITE CUBE POSTERS by JONATHAN PUCKEY AND LUNA MAURER of CONDITIONAL DESIGN</h2>
        <p>See <a href="http://jonathanpuckey.com/projects/graphic-design-in-the-white-cube/">http://jonathanpuckey.com/projects/graphic-design-in-the-white-cube/</a></p>
        <p>Form a group of ~5 students.</p>
        <p>Go to the Miro board your group has been assigned to.</p>
        <p>One person at a time</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Step 1: Place 2 Dots (see rules below)</li>
          <li>Step 2: Place 1 line of tape (see rules below)</li>
          <li>Step 3: Repeat*. Go to step 1 (new person).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>If placing a dot:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>place vertically: no more than the length of the measuring line - from last dot added</li>
          <li>place horizontal: you decide</li>
          <li>mark last dot added with a virtual post it</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>If placing line:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>line must start from a dot</li>
          <li>line must end at another line (note: if this is the first line on the page then end at a dot!)</li>
          <li>you can cross another line but a line cannot cross over more than one line</li>
        </ul>
        <p>* Keep repeating these steps until you feel your design is finished</p>
        <p>For your portfolio submission make sure you record your process and outcome by screen capturing. Ensure you capture the process as well as the final outcome. See your Meaningful Marks brief for further information on what you will be submitting in your portfolio for this task</p>

        <h2>TASK 2: POSTER FACTORY as GENERATIVE DESIGN IN CODE</h2>

        <p>You will step through this process in class, but also you can refer back to the videos below, which will act as both a consolidation of the class material and a reminder to come back to.</p>

        <p>Here is the <a href="generative-interactive-files.zip">link to download the code files</a> mentioned in the videos. You will need this files in class and to use while working through these videos.</p>

        <p>you will need open these videos in full screen to be able to see their content properly</p>

				<p> This second video gets you jumping in and playing with the code. At this stage you don't need to understanding everything in the code, just following along and see what changes you can make with simple code adjustments</p>

				<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ELVthoNSMY?rel=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

				<p><b>BONUS:</b> Open up the code in the "sol-le-wit" folder in Brackets, run it using "live preview" then make some adjustments to the code in sketch.js as suggested in the code comments.</p>

      </div>

      <div class = "spacer"></div>

      <h2>TASK 3: INTRO TO COLOUR & FORM IN CODE</h2>
			<p>Now have a look at the "generative-interactive-files > colour" folder in Brackets, and using the guidance of your studio leader, the included code comments and this video, start to experiment with colour and simple form in the "sketch.js" file. Remember to be documenting your process with screenshots of both you code and the resulting outcome in the browser.</p>
