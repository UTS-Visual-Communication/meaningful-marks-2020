# Class Overview for Generative Design and Interactive Image Task


## Task 1: Generative Poster Task (Time: Approximately 1hr)

First of all you will be leading students through a generative poster task, this will be familiar to you from your first year. We will be giving the students an algorithm, a set of step by step instructions that they themselves will carry out by hand. This is to give them some insight into the generative possibilities of using code to materialise design. How a single algorithm can create a unique compositional variations from the set of rules.

I would encourage you to run this twice - once with the rules as they are, a second time with altered rules (get them to design the rules)

1. Get students into groups of 4-5 and give them a section of the Miro board.
2. then put those groups into zoom breakout rooms, so they can speak to each other while working on the processes.
3. Before they begin please prep them for thoughtfully undertaking the task: Although students are following a set of instructions this does not mean that as designers they can carry out the task in a thoughtless manner and just let the algorithm do its thing. As designers they still have important decisions to make. What colours out of what they are given will they use, how might they combine them? And with each step they can think about how they want to be an input into how the algorithm works, will a line this way rather than another way lead to a more successful composition? At want point is the work finished? To get them started thinking about this they can take a look at what is in their kit and think about what colours they might like to use (they don't have to use all of them).
4. Students will need to show some documentation of this task for their reflection. Get them to nominate someone in their group to document some points in their process. They can just do this with a smart phone.
5. Get them to read through the instructions in full before they begin.
6. As students are working on their poster, please give them feedback or encouragement with how they are going with the task.
7. You will have to be popping in and out of the breakout rooms
8. I (Andrew) will be popping around too.
9. Try with student created algorithm / rules (bas this on how quickly they do first part)
1. Once they have all finished please take a moment to have the groups look around the Miro board and to see what happened with everyone elses posters so they can see the variation from a simple set of instructions.

## TASK 2

1. Now work with them on the processing code - There are two code examples they can open up 'poster-factory' and 'sol-le-wit'
2. This year we are using P5.js
3. Get the students to open up the index.html of each example in the browser. They can click on the canvas to generate a new compostion. Do this via the "live preview" button in Brackets
4. Get them to open up the sketch.js file in Brackets. This is a basic editor where you can edit the code. I have put some comments in the code, where they can edit the parameters and change the outcome. When they have made their edits, they need to save the sketch.js file in the editor and then go back to the index.html file they have open in the brower and refresh it. They should then see the results of how they have edited the code.

## TASK 3

1. Take students through the colour, fill and stroke commands. Including fill(), stroke(), noFill, noStroke(). Again there is a file in the folder up on UTSOnline from last week. Similar to going through the draw commands last week you can step through the commands with them.
1.	Get them to play around with this using greyscale only i.e: fill(255) (remember greyscale is a single number between 0 (black) and 255 (white))
1	Then introduce them to using r,g,b for the background() function to create different colour backgrounds. If they want to work out colours they can type ‘rgb colour picker’ into Google. This brings up Google’s colour picker where they can set the hue of a colour and then adjust its saturation or brightness. The rgb values are shown on the left.
